# Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing algorithms
 This is the implementation of a Hill Climbing algorithm and a Simulated Annealing algorithm which try to approximate the global minima for 4 different functions (**De Jong's**, **Schwefel's**, **Rastrigin's** and **Michalewicz's**)  
 Results and an in-depth analysis are presented in the Report.pdf file.
